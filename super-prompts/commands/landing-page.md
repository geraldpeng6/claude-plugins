Build a landing page showcase app for $ARGUMENTS that lets users browse
and preview different landing page design options.

The app should function as an internal design directory where team members or
stakeholders can view multiple landing page variations side-by-side before
deciding which style best represents the brand.

The main screen displays a clean, dark-themed list of all available landing
pages with the company logo and a title like "Landing Page Options."

Each option appears as a clickable card that navigates to the full landing
page preview.

Each landing page in the directory should be a complete, fully-designed
landing page.

Start off with 3 landing pages in the directory.

Over time, the user is going to be providing their thoughts and making changes
on all the landing pages.

Based on those changes, all future generations of landing pages should take
those into account, and you should improve making landing pages to their liking
as time goes on.

When asked to create new landing pages without specific direction, please
search the internet for new trending styles for landing pages that work.

This can help you come up with concepts, but make sure it aligns with the
company style and the preferences of the user.

If the user doesn't specify any styling you can ask them follow up questions
about the styling of their brand.
